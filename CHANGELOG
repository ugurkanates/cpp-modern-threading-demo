# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

### Changed
- Project version upgraded to C++14 from C++11
- std::gets(x) replaced with std::fgets(x,size of x,y) due prior being deprecated
- C type string functionality with std::string
- Changed Word to be Class type(rather than public forced Struct)
- Thread sync mechanism

### Removed
- All references to C libraries & functions

### Added
- CMake structure to have a reliable build system
- Added <mutex> and <iostream> to headers
- A better & modern C++ approved way to handle concurrency
- Starter script
- Test examples
- Condition Variable + std:: mutex to not halt on while loops as well as handling notification pattern
- Crticial section control
- s_word act as shared mem along with static data(vect)
- Lambda function + std::find_if to use my overloaded == operator , std::find only compares pointers
- Two threads (1 producer + 1 consumer ) + one main thread is better

## Shortcomings
 * If user enters "end" as first word still completes first thread job , but second thread handles it. There could be
a way to even terminate first thread before but complicates / make ugly code this is ok.
 * Tried to use const as much as possible , but too much useless dynamic allocation is well useless so I removed some
 * there is a little bug in static_method i define but didnt use for not duplicating std::find_if lambda, minor thing
 * Didn't handle if no "end" appears.
 * to terminate enter  "KILLME"
